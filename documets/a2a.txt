Yesterday Google released agent to agent
0:03
protocol and in this video I will
0:04
provide a very intuitive explanation of
0:07
what exactly it is. Obviously you need
0:09
to know what are AI agents. If you don't
0:12
I am linking couple of videos and here
0:14
is a demo of Google agent space which
0:18
uses A2A protocol. So let's say if you
0:21
are an organization you are hiring a
0:23
software engineer you can attach PDF
0:25
file into this agent space and it will
0:30
discover the agents which will help with
0:32
the task. Okay so that is the first step
0:35
in A2A protocol which is this particular
0:39
client. Okay the the chatbot that you're
0:42
seeing is able to discover other agents.
0:45
So this chatbot itself is an agent but
0:48
it is having this capability to discover
0:52
other agents which can help it perform
0:54
particular task. So it found this
0:56
particular sourcing agent and then it is
1:00
talking to that. Okay. So it is talking
1:02
to that using a protocol. You see agent
1:06
protocol. So agent protocol allows one
1:09
agent to talk to other agent in a
1:13
standardized way. So I will just show
1:15
you the complete demo here. It uh talked
1:18
to that other agent and it is asking you
1:21
this clarifying question. Okay. Do you
1:24
need a person in plus and minus 3 hours
1:27
of US specific time? Uh so now you are
1:30
getting into collaboration where clients
1:32
and agent must support dynamic
1:34
interaction where you can ask clarifying
1:36
questions. Okay, what kind of
1:37
requirements you have for this
1:39
particular uh job requirement and and
1:42
that is also part of that standard
1:45
protocol. Okay. So you clarify
1:48
uh your requirement here and then uh so
1:51
this is that user experience negotiation
1:54
and it will go to some platforms and it
1:57
will find all these job profiles and you
2:00
can just say please reach out to
2:02
schedule interviews and maybe for
2:03
interviews you can use multiple agents.
2:08
So the idea here is as an end user
2:10
you're talking to client which was that
2:12
Google agent workspace and it has one
2:15
base agent which is your remote agent
2:17
and to accomplish a task it might be
2:21
talking to couple of other agents and
2:24
wherever you are seeing this green arrow
2:27
that's where you are applying A2A
2:30
protocol. It's very simple agent to
2:32
agent protocol. Now you might wonder how
2:36
is it different from model context
2:38
protocol. And by the way if you don't
2:40
know about MCP I have another video with
2:42
a simple explanation. So let me give you
2:45
an analogy to explain how this is
2:48
different from MCP. Let's say you are a
2:51
car repair guy. Uh in our LLM analogy
2:56
this person is an LLM and to fix a tire
3:00
or something you need all these tools
3:02
right? See these are all the tools that
3:04
you need to perform various tasks such
3:07
as removing the screws, fixing the tire
3:09
pressure and so
3:10
on. And this entire system where you
3:14
have LLM which is this car repair guy,
3:17
he has all these tools and both of them
3:21
are accomplishing certain task. So this
3:24
entire system is called agent which can
3:27
accomplish certain tasks such as fixing
3:29
tire pressure or fixing whatever. Okay.
3:32
And to
3:34
communicate, LLM will use this MCP. So
3:38
MCP is a protocol
3:41
that helps LLM communicate with tools,
3:45
resources, prompt, and so on. But in
3:49
real life, agent will communicate with
3:52
another agent. So if you're a car repair
3:55
person, you might have to communicate
3:58
with your customer or your part
4:01
supplier and you will have often this
4:06
backto back back and forth communication
4:08
where you're saying okay customer is
4:10
saying it shows a tire pressure warning.
4:13
You will say okay I fixed it let me
4:15
check again and you might find out that
4:18
your pressure sensor is broken. then
4:21
customer will say okay how much will it
4:23
cost? So there is this back and forth.
4:25
So part of the protocol is that you need
4:28
to enable this back and forth
4:30
communication in a standardized way. So
4:33
to summarize A2A is a protocol which uh
4:38
allows AI agents to communicate with
4:43
each other in a standardized way. And
4:45
I'm going to link a page from Google.
4:48
Google came up with this particular
4:51
protocol which is used by many companies
4:53
by the way. Intuitit, lang chain,
4:55
MongoDB, there are many companies which
4:57
has started using this already. Now you
5:02
need to know certain concept. The first
5:04
one is agent card. So when this lady
5:07
wants to repair her car, she has some
5:11
way of discovering the right car repair
5:15
person. And that discovery happens
5:17
through agent card. Okay. So let's say
5:20
she might has have different needs. For
5:23
example, uh she need a person to repair
5:25
her car and she might know a couple of
5:29
car repair people. And then she will
5:32
have information on a person who can
5:35
help her sell the car. So car dealer.
5:38
Okay. So she might have a directory
5:41
where or a registry where she has all
5:44
these agent cards and she knows the name
5:46
of the person the description what kind
5:48
of skills this person has. Entre mishra
5:51
has skills of selling used cars, car
5:53
financing whereas John Pandya has all
5:56
these skills of oil change, tire repair
5:58
and so on. So I'm showing uh the
6:01
official documentation where they talk
6:04
about discovering agent cards. So let's
6:07
say if you are a client who is working
6:11
on solving uh some task let's say
6:14
finding software engineer you know that
6:16
Google agents workspace demo that we saw
6:20
now you need to have some way to
6:22
discover what other agents you can work
6:25
with just like that uh lady customer she
6:28
has all that agent cards or agent tool
6:32
registry agent registry rather where she
6:35
knows that there is this person who is a
6:38
car dealer, there is this person who is
6:40
a repair person, there is this person
6:42
who is the shop owner and so on. So
6:46
similarly here there are multiple ways
6:49
you can discover agents. The first way
6:53
is you can use this particular
6:56
agent.json file and clients will use DNS
7:00
to resolve known or found domain. Okay.
7:03
The other one is registry based where
7:07
for an AI application here is the
7:11
registry of trusted agents. Okay. And
7:14
they're still working on this protocol.
7:16
This is sort of like work in progress.
7:18
Uh but there will be some kind of
7:21
registry. There is a private discovery
7:23
also. Okay. There are multiple ways
7:26
where a client or the remote agent can
7:30
discover other agents. Okay.
7:33
Then comes the agent card. So this is
7:37
once again a protocol. So you have a
7:40
standardized way of showing your agent
7:43
card and this is the typescript. This is
7:45
the schema. So you should have agent
7:48
card. Then you should have name,
7:49
description, URL. So these these things
7:51
are must. Okay, you understand what the
7:53
protocol is. Protocol is basically
7:56
defining that standard uh in which you
7:59
are going to communicate. So if you are
8:02
an agent uh and you want
8:05
to send your agent card to other agent,
8:10
it has to be in this format. Okay, it
8:12
should have provider like which company
8:14
it is. Okay, Google, whatever whatever
8:16
that company is. U if you're writing an
8:21
a a an agent which can uh help you buy
8:24
groceries, then that company which is
8:26
creating that agent that will be the
8:28
organization name here. the capabilities
8:31
and so on. Okay. Uh there is this task
8:34
object also. So when you are giving a
8:37
task to solve it has to be in this
8:40
format. Okay. So there are different
8:42
specification here. But let me just show
8:44
you some sample. So if you scroll
8:48
down this is an agent card for Google
8:51
maps agent. So that is an agent which
8:53
will help you with Google map related
8:55
task. So this is the URL. This is the
8:57
organization. These are the
8:59
capabilities. See, it will have multiple
9:01
skills. So, first skill is route
9:03
planning. Second skill is custom map and
9:06
so on. Then when you send a task, see,
9:09
you will say tell me a joke. This is a
9:11
different uh task by the way, not
9:12
related to Google map. Uh but this is
9:15
how you will specify your task and your
9:17
response will come here and it is using
9:20
JSON RPC as a communication protocol. Uh
9:23
and as a data exchange format you are
9:25
using JSON. So uh this is not like
9:28
replacing HTTP or JSON RPC etc. The A2A
9:32
protocol is built on top of HTTP, JSON
9:37
RPC
9:38
um you know some other protocols, bunch
9:41
of other protocols which which I will
9:42
talk about in this particular document.
9:46
So you can uh read through all these uh
9:50
sometimes you need you have streaming
9:53
requirements. So you want to communicate
9:56
through SSC. So A2A protocol also
9:58
supports SSE and this is the example of
10:02
that. Let's say you are writing a long
10:04
paper. Okay, on some topic now you need
10:07
to stream the response. So you can
10:10
stream it like this. Okay, this is
10:11
section one, section two and so
10:14
on. And it supports multimodality as
10:18
well. Uh it also supports error
10:20
handling. And then here is a nice
10:22
article on um A2A versus MCP and the
10:27
garage example that I use. I I I got the
10:31
inspiration from this. There are a bunch
10:33
of diagrams that you can find it useful.
10:36
Uh now let me show you
10:41
the there is some code as well. So here
10:45
there is a code code of an uh agent
10:48
which is acting as a server. So it it
10:50
will obviously uh display that uh agent
10:54
card. So see agent card format is same
10:56
as the schema that we saw. It has name,
10:58
description, URL, the skills and skills
11:01
is an array. So it can have multiple
11:03
skills. So one of the skills is let's
11:05
say this this is an example of a
11:08
reimbursement tool. So your skill is you
11:12
can process reimbursement tool. So if
11:15
you are an organization which is
11:16
building this agentic tool which can
11:19
reimburse your expenses then you can use
11:21
a A2A protocol and you can build one
11:24
agent which is a reimbursement tool.
11:27
Okay. So this is just the main server
11:30
file. The actual implementation of
11:33
reimbursement tool is here. So you will
11:36
see a class which is your reimbursement
11:38
agent. So this is an agent. An agent
11:41
will have some capability. What is that
11:42
capability? Well, it uses Gemini 2.0
11:46
flash model. It can do this thing. This
11:49
is the prompt that it will use to pass
11:52
the task over to an LLM. So, it is using
11:56
some LLM. It is using tools. Of course,
11:59
agents is nothing but LLM plus tools.
12:02
Okay. So,
12:03
this entire class is nothing but an
12:07
agent. But this agent is communicating
12:11
with other agents. Okay. It is providing
12:14
all these capabilities through the agent
12:16
card that I have these capabilities so
12:19
that other agents can use this
12:22
particular
12:23
agent. All right. So I hope you
12:25
understand uh now what exactly A2A is.
12:28
I'm going to link all these documents
12:30
for your detailed understanding. This
12:32
was released just yesterday. So uh we'll
12:36
have to see you know what kind of impact
12:38
this has in the world of AI. It is still
12:41
new lot of things are being evolved. So
12:44
it it starts a new era for agent
12:47
interoperability and it is going to be a
12:50
very good development
12:52
uh for companies and organizations which
12:54
are building this agentic tools. All
12:57
right. Thank you very much for watching.
